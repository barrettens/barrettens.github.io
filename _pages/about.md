Barrett Ens is a Senior Lecturer in the Faculty of Information Technology at Monash University and a member of the Data Visualisation and Immersive Analytics research group. He is an emerging leader in the rapidly growing field of Immersive Analytics, which bridges expertise across the areas human-computer interaction, data visualisation, augmented reality and virtual reality. He recevied a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Manitoba in 2016. During this program, he also completed two research internships with the User Interface Research Group at Autodesk Research. He later worked as an NSERC Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Empathic Computing Lab at the University of South Australia.


Research Interests
======

Barrettâ€™s current research focuses on enabling next-generation user interfaces for emerging display and interaction technologies. With an aim of creating useful interface designs for engaging and productive experiences, his research explores how to take advantage of human spatial abilities for manipulating and understanding information beyond the confines of traditional flat screens. Maturing technologies such as augmented reality, digital twins and wearable computing devices allow us to begin integrating computing activities into the physical world. This fundamental change in interface design will provide new opportunities to interact with smart environments, explore large data sets, and solve everyday problems.
