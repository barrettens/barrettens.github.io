Research interests
======

Barrettâ€™s current research focuses on interacting with data in immersive environments, with an aim of improving the productivity of interaction to enable more complex and useful systems. This research explores how to take advantage of human spatial abilities for manipulating and understanding information beyond the confines of traditional flat displays. Maturing technologies such as augmented reality (AR), the internet of things (IoT) and wearable computing devices allow us to begin integrating computing activities into the physical world. This fundamental change in interface design will provide new opportunities to interact with smart environments, explore large data sets, and solve everyday problems.
